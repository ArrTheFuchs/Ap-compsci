Compile-time errors- prevent the program from compiling aka syntax errors
Run-time errors- errors that are produced when the program runs.
Logic errors- cause the program to do something other than what you wanted
One error can make 100 error messages
Start from the beginning when debugging
The error will not always be where the compiler says it is
Debugging by bisection- last resort
Solutions offered by the compiler are not always accurate
If a program hangs then it has most likely entered an infinite loop
Add occasional print statements to visualize the flow of code.
The compiler will not tell you where logic errors are located
ArrayIndexOutOfBoudnsException means that you tried to access a point in the array that is non-existent
When faced with compile-time errors make sure that there is
Proper invocation of methods
Correct type matching
Proper opening and closing [], “” , (), and {}
